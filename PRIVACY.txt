Privacy Policy

The YaShlang project aims to provide a private, anonymous experience for using media web services. The app does not collect any data, does not require login and does not identify its users in any way.

However, media streams, shown in the app, are taken from 3-pty services (such as YouTube), so, while loading content, the app would request data from 3-pty services on your behalf. While such requests are fully anonymous, you should concider getting acquanted with privacy policies of those 3-pty services (such as YouTube).
