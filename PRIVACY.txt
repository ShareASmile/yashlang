Privacy Policy

The YaShlang project aims to provide a private, anonymous experience
for using media web services. The app does not collect any data, does
not require login and does not identify its users in any way.

However, media streams, shown in the app, are taken from 3-pty services
(such as YouTube), so, while loading content, the app would request data
from 3-pty services on your behalf. While such requests would only access
data which is publically available, would not require login and are fully
anonymous, you should consider getting acquanted with privacy policies
of those 3-pty services (such as YouTube).
